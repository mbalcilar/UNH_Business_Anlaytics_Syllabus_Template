\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course reviews statistical concepts and methods with emphasis on
data analytics and visualizations. Topics to be covered include
descriptive statistics, plots and graphs for discrete and continuous
data, statistical inference, regression, and selected non-parametrics
including chi-square. In addition, power pivot and other Excel
analytical tools will be covered. Students will obtain a solid
introduction to R as a functional programming language and will be able
to use Excel and R to effectively compute statistical and graphical
procedures.

\hypertarget{course-format}{%
\section{Course Format}\label{course-format}}

The course will be delivered as a fully on-ground course, with every
student meeting in person.

\hypertarget{required-text}{%
\section{Required Text}\label{required-text}}

\emph{OpenIntro Statistics}, Christopher D. Barr, David M. Diez, and
Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, 4th Edition, 2019. This is a free eBook,
available at \url{http://openintro.org/os/pdf}.

New and used hard copies of the book can be purchased at
\href{https://www.amazon.com/OpenIntro-Statistics-Fourth-color-interior/dp/1943450226/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XKV3CDPZPZDG\&keywords=OpenIntro+Statistics\&qid=1692970332\&sprefix=openintro+statistics\%2Caps\%2C84\&sr=8-1}{Amazon}.

\hypertarget{required-software}{%
\section{Required Software}\label{required-software}}

All students are rewuired to use
\href{https://www.r-project.org}{\textbf{R}} and
\href{https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/}{\textbf{RStudio}},
a no-cost add-on coding environment for R provided by
\href{https://posit.co}{\textbf{Posit}}. R serves as a statistical
programming language, while R Studio operates as a third-party software
user interface designed for R. These tools will find application in
nearly all course assignments. R is available under the GNP General
Public License, compatible with various operating systems, including
Windows and Mac OS. Similarly, RStudio can be downloaded free of charge.
The computer lab has already installed both R and R-Studio. You have the
option to download them onto your personal computer as outlined below:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{R:} \href{https://cran.r-project.org}{https://cran.r-project.org}
\item[] \textbf{R-Studio:} \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop}
\end{itemize}

Posit web page for RStudio will suggest the appropriate version for your
operating system. Furthermore, the College of Business has acquired a
license to locally operate the RStudio server at the University of New
Haven. This server is accessible at

\begin{center}
{\bfseries \href{rstudio.newhaven.edu:8787}{rstudio.newhaven.edu:8787} }
\end{center}

Additionally, it serves as a safeguard, ensuring that all R scripts are
preserved in the event that any files are inadvertently lost within your
desktop directories. You will be provide with your ID and password
during the first week of the class. Using the online server presents a
viable alternative in case you encounter technical difficulties with R
on your personal computer. The RStdio Server offers enhanced
convenience, allowing access to R from home, the classroom, or the
library using any browser, computer, or tablet. Moreover, it facilitates
the centralization of all your coursework in one location.

Posit also offers a free cloud bases RStudio server. For more
information, please refer to: \url{https://posit.cloud/plans/free}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  to help students understand basic statistics and analytics concepts,
  and
\item
  to help students learn fundamental tools that will allow them to

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-requirements-assessment}{%
\section{Course Requirements \&
Assessment}\label{course-requirements-assessment}}

Describe course assignments and assessment and where/when/if a camera
will be required for each assignment and assessment.

\hypertarget{expectations}{%
\subsection{Expectations}\label{expectations}}

This course will require significant in-class and out-of-class
commitment from each student. The University estimates that a student
should expect to spend two hours outside of class for each hour they are
in a class. (For example, a three-credit course would average six
{[}6{]} hours of additional work \underline{outside} of class).

This course will teach you coding in \texttt{R} language at the
intermediate level. Learning coding could be challenging in the
beginning. You are expected to practice coding on a continuous basis and
ask help from the instructor/TAs when you encounter an issue. Learning
statistical concepts and analytics will occur simultaneous to students
learning \texttt{R}. It is advantageous, but not required to know basis
statistical concepts.

\hypertarget{exams}{%
\subsection{Exams}\label{exams}}

There will be a midterm and a final exam. Check the schedule below for
the exam dates. Contact the instructor if you have any schedule conflict
with another course. All exams will be taken during class session.

\hypertarget{homework}{%
\subsection{Homework}\label{homework}}

There will be several homework assignments during the semester. Your
answer for each homework should be uploaded to Canvas by the due date.
If a submission is late, it will receive no credit. Contact the
instructor if you believe that extenuating circumstances prevail but be
aware that exceptions will be made only for truly exceptional
situations. Extra credit homework could be assigned at the discretion of
the instructor.

\hypertarget{datacamp.com}{%
\subsection{Datacamp.com}\label{datacamp.com}}

It is strongly recommended that you finish a free course on statistical
programming language \texttt{R} to speed up your understanding of coding
in \texttt{R}. The name of this online course is
\texttt{Introduction\ to\ R} and provided by \url{datacamp.com}. You
receive a Certificate of Completion at the end. Also, you will get one
full homework credits for completing this course. Register for
\url{datacamp.com} using
\href{https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/47a7ed52e9916a007f7d4935715bcb752027ec071fca98fb44eb10f407c7324}{this
link}. You may also receive an invitation from the course (arranged by
the instructor). One side benefit signing up for \url{datacamp.com} is
that all other courses offered at this site will be free for you for 6
months.

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\subsection{Extra Credit}\label{extra-credit}}

All students will have periodic opportunities for extra credit
throughout the semester. Exams typically include extra credit inquiries,
for instance. Additionally, there will be extra credit practice
assignments. For reasons of fairness, no individual opportunities for
extra credit will be offered.

\hypertarget{attendance-and-class-participation}{%
\subsection{Attendance and Class
Participation}\label{attendance-and-class-participation}}

You are expected to participate in all class activities, and you should
be prepared to contribute to the discussions and class work. This class
moves at a demanding pace and requires consistent attendance to be
successful. Attendance will be taken but will not be graded. It is
recognized that absences may be unavoidable due to illness or family
emergency. In this event, students are expected to keep up with their
readings and assignments. Absences for more than two (2) weeks is
detrimental to a student's ability to keep up with the course work. In
this event, the instructor's permission is required for satisfactory
completion of the course. Whether excused or not, excessive absences may
result in a failing grade since these signify a failure to fulfill
course requirements. Attendance will be recorded via the Qwickly
Attendance application that is embedded in Canvas. Students will receive
a pin code to record their attendance. If a student fails to log their
attendance in Qwickly, then it is their responsibility to get with the
instructor within 48 hours of the class to correct the attendance
reporting issue.

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth
together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value
data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this
course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is
important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't
know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think
you know.

\textbf{If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via
