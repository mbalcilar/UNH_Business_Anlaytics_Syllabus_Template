# Course Description

This course reviews statistical concepts and methods with emphasis on data analytics and visualizations. Topics to be covered include descriptive statistics, plots and graphs for discrete and continuous data, statistical inference, regression, and selected non-parametrics including chi-square. In addition, power pivot and other Excel analytical tools will be covered. Students will obtain a solid introduction to R as a functional programming language and will be able to use Excel and R to effectively compute statistical and graphical procedures.


# Course Format 

The course will be delivered as a fully on-ground course, with every student meeting in person.

# Required Text
\emph{OpenIntro Statistics}, Christopher D. Barr, David M. Diez, and Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, 4th Edition, 2019. This is a free eBook, available at [http://openintro.org/os/pdf](http://openintro.org/os/pdf).

New and used hard copies of the book can be purchased at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/OpenIntro-Statistics-Fourth-color-interior/dp/1943450226/ref=sr_1_1?crid=XKV3CDPZPZDG&keywords=OpenIntro+Statistics&qid=1692970332&sprefix=openintro+statistics%2Caps%2C84&sr=8-1).

# Required Software

All students are rewuired to use [**R**](https://www.r-project.org) and [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/), a no-cost add-on coding environment for R provided by [**Posit**](https://posit.co). R serves as a statistical programming language, while R Studio operates as a third-party software user interface designed for R. These tools will find application in nearly all course assignments. R is available under the GNP General Public License, compatible with various operating systems, including Windows and Mac OS. Similarly, RStudio can be downloaded free of charge. The computer lab has already installed both R and R-Studio. You have the option to download them onto your personal computer as outlined below:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textbf{R:} \href{https://cran.r-project.org}{https://cran.r-project.org}
\item[] \textbf{R-Studio:} \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop}
\end{itemize}

Posit web page for RStudio will suggest the appropriate version for your operating system.
Furthermore, the College of Business has acquired a license to locally operate the RStudio server at the University of New Haven. This server is accessible at

\begin{center}
{\bfseries \href{rstudio.newhaven.edu:8787}{rstudio.newhaven.edu:8787} }
\end{center}

Additionally, it serves as a safeguard, ensuring that all R scripts are preserved in the event that any files are inadvertently lost within your desktop directories. You will be provide with your ID and password during the first week of the class. Using the online server presents a viable alternative in case you encounter technical difficulties with R on your personal computer. The RStdio Server offers enhanced convenience, allowing access to R from home, the classroom, or the library using any browser, computer, or tablet. Moreover, it facilitates the centralization of all your coursework in one location.

Posit also offers a free cloud bases RStudio server. For more information, please refer to: [https://posit.cloud/plans/free](https://posit.cloud/plans/free).

1. to help students understand basic statistics and analytics concepts, and
2. to help students learn fundamental tools that will allow them to tackle with business

analytics challenges.

# Course Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students should be able to:

1. demonstrate basic statistical skills and data exploration,
2. conduct data analysis using appropriate statistical software, and
3. present data analysis graphically.


# Course Requirements & Assessment
Describe course assignments and assessment and where/when/if a camera will be required for each assignment and assessment.

## Expectations

Edit the statement as appropriate for this course.

<This course will require significant in-class and out-of-class commitment from each student.  The University estimates that a student should expect to spend two hours outside of class for each hour they are in a class.  (For example, a three-credit course would average six [6] hours of additional work outside of class).>

# Writing requirements

For this class to fulfill the (W) requirements of USA, you will be doing a semester-long research project in an area related to sedimentology. To build your skills in discipline-specific writing, we will be doing smaller writing assignments throughout the semester. The final projects will be peer-reviewed, revised, and then submitted for final grading and assessment.

# Important Dates
January 17th - Last day to drop without WD\
April 1st - Last day to drop or withdraw\
See the [Academic Calendar](https://www.southalabama.edu/academiccalendar/) for more information.

\newpage

# Course goals

1.  Observe, describe, classify, and communicate characteristics of sediments and sedimentary rocks.

2.  Develop a framework for building hypotheses about the distributions of sediments, sedimentary structures, and sedimentary environments.

3.  Communicate sedimentary geology to a variety of audiences using different genres of writing.

4.  Read and summarize scientific papers focused on sedimentary geology and related fields.

# Class textbooks

There is no required textbook for this fall, however I recommend getting these books from the library or used versions to compliment the lectures. Without a required textbook I will also be assigning technical papers to read throughout the semester. We will discuss these and you will build your technical reading skills along with your writing skills.

# Student conduct

## Attendance policy

-   Students who complete less than 50% of assignments/exams will be assigned a failing (F) grade.

-   Review the 'Attendance and Absences Policy', in the Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletin for attendance and absences policy

## Grading

### Late policy
I will be grading assignments in batches to provide fair assessment to everyone. This means late work can be disruptive. The penalty for late work will be 20% a day after the first 24 hours late. If you have a reasonable excuse (illness, etc.) the late policy may be relaxed.

### Extra credit
Extra credit may be made available throughout the semester at my discretion.

Assignments will be returned within a week of submission.

```{r Grades_Table, echo=FALSE}
kable(Grades,
      align = c("l", "r"))
```

Assignment weighting will follow:
```{r Weights_Table, echo=FALSE}
kable(Weights,
      align = c("l", "r"))
```

## Course and Teacher evaluation
Student input for the purpose of course improvement is taken very seriously and will potentially be done periodically. Please take the time to evaluate this course and the instructor, especially at the end of the semester. Evaluations will in no way affect your grade.

\newpage
# Safety

## Field Safety

### Transportation
Wear your seatbelts at all times while in moving vehicles. Do not distract the driver.

### Location awareness
Be aware of potential dangers (animals, weather, etc) and avoid them. When in a group, please think about the safety of your peers.

## Building Safety

### Fire
Random fire safety drills may occur during the course of the term. You will be expected to evacuate the building and assemble at the designated location: outside by the northeast corner of the building (follow your instructor).

### Tornado
Move away from external windows to the hallway in the basement, first, or second floor. 

### Active Shooter Incident
"Get Out" of the building as long as they can do so safely. Once you have exited the building and are at a safe location, "Call Out" to law enforcement using 911, USA Police at 460-6312, or press the Emergency button on your LiveSafe Mobile Safety App. If you can't get out, "Shelter in Place" in a secure location that is away from windows and doors, preferably a location that can be locked and barricaded.

\newpage
# On writing

## Revising written work

Nothing is perfect on the first draft. We all revise and rework our written creations for a variety of reasons. We may not communicate the point we want to get across to all readers. We may have forgotten or not known important pieces of information initially. The tone of the writing may be inappropriate for the audience. Word choice might obscure meaning. The only way we can make our writing better is by revising it based on constructive feedback from others or ourselves.

## Genres of Science writing

### Paper reviews

Critical but constructive critique of unpublished research papers. Informs the journal editor of how the work contributes to existing literature and provides guide to authors and the editor for improvement to the manuscript. Can be signed but often anonymous.

### Descriptive Reports

Descriptive reports are often made for industry or geological surveys. These describe the composition and structure of rocks in an area. Sometimes they include estimations of resource potentials or environmental impacts of industry.

### Research papers

These pieces of science writing typically test one or more closely related hypotheses in the context of existing scientific knowledge. Most have structure that is pre-defined including: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Figures are an integral part of most papers in the Geosciences and range from images of outcrops to abstracted summaries of observations to plots of measurements.

### Conference abstracts

These are generally a step on the path to a full research publication where results, interpretations, and context are publicly presented for the first time.

### Grant Applications

Scientific work is generally funded with public or private funds that are obtained by writing grants. Unlike research papers, grants must persuade reviewers that the research planned is important, can be done by the applicant, and can be achieved in the time frame of the funding request.

### Science Communication

Scientists also write general summaries of their work for non-specialist audiences. These can be blog posts, or lesson plans that are shared for educators. Some folks also write books for general audiences describing the processes of science.

## Common processes

For writing in the discipline, we focus on several specific questions to guide our composition:
1) Who is our audience?
2) What is the one or two sentence take-home point?
3) How quickly are we communicating the information?

Science writing, like all writing, is socially situated and caries with it the beliefs, values, and ideologies of the particular community and culture.

## Tips and tricks for good writing
Use a citation management software to organize your papers and create bibiliographies. My preference is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) because it is free, open source, and works across multiple operating systems.

Write and then revise. Ask for feedback from peers or wait until you have some distance from your writing and then revise.

Prompt yourself with questions that have short, concrete answers.

# Final thoughts

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think you know.
