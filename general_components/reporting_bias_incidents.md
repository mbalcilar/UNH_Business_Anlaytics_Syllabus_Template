# Reporting Bias Incidents

At the University of New Haven, there is an expectation that all community members are committed to creating and supporting a climate which promotes civility, mutual respect, and open-mindedness. There also exists an understanding that with the freedom of expression comes the responsibility to support community membersâ€™ right to live and work in an environment free from harassment and fear. It is expected that all members of the University community will engage in anti-bias behavior and refrain from actions that intimidate, humiliate, or demean persons or groups or that undermine their security or self-esteem. 
 
If you have an immediate safety concern for yourself or others, and/or believe someone poses an immediate threat to themselves or others, please contact University Police at 203-932-7070 or call 911. Community members can report bias-motivated incidents by completing the form at [www.newhaven.edu/biasreporting](www.newhaven.edu/biasreporting). Community members are encouraged to complete this form if they are the target of bias or harassing behaviors, witness such behaviors, or gain knowledge of these behaviors occurring within the University community.  All matters concerning bias and harassment will be handled by the Dean of Students Office and Human Resources Office.
